    <br>
    <center><p>The Cape is full of mountains and provides a mecca of climbing. Cape Town being the main center is a good base to start from. There are a few clubs mainly the MCSA Cape Town Section which has over 1200 members and a bouldering wall in their club room. Good climbing is only a few minutes drive from Cape Town and the furthermost areas about 4-5 hours away. There are hundreds of crags outside of the city at <strong>Du Toit's Kloof, Montagu, Paarl, the Cederberg</strong> as well as other locations. There are also great bouldering opportunities in <strong>Rocklands.</strong>. Beginners are always welcomed. Instructors will show you the basics, teach you about safety and get you onto rock for your first rock climbing experience.
<br>
<strong>Important note</strong>:Cape-Climbers refer to as the "Schlauk Factor"-the rock becomes so slippery and even damp that it seems as if someone smeared oil onto the holds. Climbing is near impossible unless you have a bucket of chalk to compensate! Always climb in groups, try not to climb alone!
